## Motivation
When I took Intro to Linguistics (LING 201) in McGill, I found drawing syntax tree with a bunch of recursive square brackets ([[[][[[]]][]][]]) is exhausting, and it gets even worse when modifying the tree, relocating a subtree, adding triangles, or drawing movements. I dreamed of a tool that can simplify the creation of a syntax tree.

While there are a few GUI programs such as [TreeForm](http://www.mapsofspeech.com/2017/10/02/treeform/) [Linguistic Tree Constructor](http://ltc.sourceforge.net/), they require specific platforms (Windows) and dependencies (.NET, Java...). Obviously, opening a web page would be much easier than a installing a desktop software. 

## Features
- Interactive
- Serverless (Static Webpage)
- Fully client-side drawing (Works Offline Once Loaded)
- Vertor graphics, crystal-clear image
- Easy export to SVG and PNG
