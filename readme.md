[Try it here](!https://jhcccc.github.io/EasySyntaxTree/) **This project is still in development.** Important features like drawing movements is yet to be implemented. **Pull requests are more than welcomed.**

## Motivation
When I took Intro to Linguistics (LING 201) in McGill, I found drawing syntax tree painful. Working with a bunch of recursive square brackets ([[[][[[]]][]][]]) is exhausting, and it gets even worse when modifying the tree, relocating a subtree, adding triangles, or drawing movements. I dreamed of a tool that can simplify the creation of a syntax tree.

## Features
